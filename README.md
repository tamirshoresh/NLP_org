<h1>Comparing BERT and ELMo on a Sentiment Analysis Task using IMDb Reviews Database</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This paper investigates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and two popular word embedding algorithms, ELMo and BERT, for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a way to classify text based on its content and context. In this study, BERT and ELMo were compared on their performance in classifying a movie review dataset containing 50K reviews as positive or negative. The best performing model was BERT with an accuracy of 89% on the test set, followed by ELMo with an accuracy of 69%. This work demonstrates promising results for both word embedding models and offers a comparison that can be expanded to support claims on other datasets.
